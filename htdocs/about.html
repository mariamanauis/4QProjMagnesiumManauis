        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
            Tabs & Slabs started as a passion project of a group of friends who were extremely frustrated about how hard it was and 
            still is to find less popular books in the Philippines. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We started as a small shop in Maginhawa, selling our collection of well-loved books at an affordable price. 
            Today, we are a bookstore offering new and second hand books at affordable prices. 
            We also recently started PrOCureâ€”a free book borrowing system for books written by POC authors. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We aim to make reading an accessible hobby not just for readers but for everyone. We also welcome artists and other creatives 
            in our store. You may even find some of their works at the back of the book sleeves of our hardcover books. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At present, we're partnered up with publishing houses and other local businesses to promote less mainstream books, 
            especially by authors of color. Our recent partnership with Gigs & Swigs allowed us to offer packages of books with 
            curated playlists filled with songs from OPM bands to make your reading experience more immersive and enjoyable. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We also accept donations of second hand books so if you are interested, you can drop by our store from 9 AM until 9 PM daily. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are fully committed to making our bookstore a safe space for everyone. We hope that when you enter our store, you may find 
            comfort in our books and the services from other local businesses that helped shape what Tabs & Slabs is today. 
        </p>
